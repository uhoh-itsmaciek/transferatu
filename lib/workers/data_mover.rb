module Transferatu

  # A DataMover transfers data between a data Source and a data Sink.
  # Both of these must support a simple API consisting of three
  # methods; both are very similar.
  #
  # For a Source:
  #
  # #perform_async - Asynchronously start producing data and return
  #                  an IO stream the data should be read from.
  # #wait          - Wait for the source of the data to drain and
  #                  be fully read by the consumer. The source
  #                  stream should return true from #eof? before
  #                  #wait returns. Should return true iff the
  #                  Source drained all its data to the source
  #                  stream.
  # #alive?        - Check if process is still running, by checking
  #                  if the monitor thread is still running.
  #                  Note: this thread is a just a c function which
  #                  calls wait(2).
  # #cancel        - Cancel producing data (but do not close the
  #                  source). Note that #wait will still be called
  #                  after #cancel, and should return as promptly
  #                  as possible. If #cancel is called, #wait must
  #                  return false.
  # For a Sink:
  #
  # #perform_async - Asynchronously start consuming data and return
  #                  an IO stream the data should be written to.
  #                  The stream will be closed by the DataMover to
  #                  indicate it's done writing data.
  # #wait          - Wait for the Sink to finish processing
  #                  data written to its input stream. Must be
  #                  called after the input stream is closed. Should
  #                  return true iff the Sink read and processed all
  #                  data from the stream.
  # #alive?        - Check if process is still running, by checking
  #                  if the monitor thread is still running.
  #                  Note: this thread is a just a c function which
  #                  calls wait(2).
  # #cancel        - Cancel consuming data (but do not close the
  #                  Sink). Note that #wait will still be called
  #                  after #cancel. If #cancel is called, #wait must
  #                  return false.
  #
  # Given these, a DataMover can transfer data from Source to Sink,
  # expose progress, and propagate cancelations.
